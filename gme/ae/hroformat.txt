The data may be read with the format statement
(2I4,4I3,3I4,2I7,F6.2,I7, 8F8.2,4F8.1,F7.2,F9.0,F6.2,2F7.2,F6.1,6F8.2,7I6,F7.2)

* Note For 5-min data  we added fluxes from GOES at the end of each record
 in format:
  Proton Flux >10 MeV, 1/(cm**2-sec-ster)  F9.2 See  footnote J below
  Proton Flux >30 MeV, 1/(cm**2-sec-ster)  F9.2
  Proton Flux >60 MeV, 1/(cm**2-sec-ster)  F9.2

Footnote A:

Percent interp: The percent (0-100) of the points contributing to 
the 1-min magnetic field averages whose phase front normal (PFN) 
was interpolated because neither the MVAB-0 nor Cross Product 
shift techniques yielded a PFN that satisfied its respective tests 
(see detailed documentation for these).

Footnote C: 

The DBOT (Duration Between Observing Times) words: For a 
given record, we take the 1-min average time shift and estimate, 
using the solar wind velocity and the location of the observing 
spacecraft, the time at which the corresponding observation 
would have been made at the spacecraft. Then we take the 
difference between this time and the corresponding time of 
the preceding 1-min record and define this as DBOT1. This 
difference would be one minute in the absence of PFN and/or 
flow velocity variations. When this difference becomes negative, 
we have apparent out-of- sequence arrivals of phase planes. 
That is, if plane A is observed before plane B at the spacecraft, 
plane B is predicted to arrive at the target before plane A. 
Searching for negative DBOT enables finding of such cases.

DBOT2 is like DBOT1 except that the observation time for 
the current 1-min record is compared to the latest (most time-
advanced) previous observation time and not to the observation 
time of the previous record. Use of DBOT2 helps to find 
extended intervals of out-of-sequence arrivals.

We do not capture out-of-sequence-arrival information at 15-s 
resolution but only at 1-min resolution. The standard deviation 
in the 1-min averaged time shifts may be used to help find cases 
of out-of-sequence 15-s data. 

Footnote D: 

The following spacecraft ID's are used:
	ACE	71
	Geotail	60
	IMP 8	50
	Wind	51

Footnote E: 

Note that standard deviations for the two vectors are given
as the square roots of the sum of squares of the standard deviations
in the component averages.  The component averages are given in
the records but not their individual standard deviations.

Footnote F: 

There are no phase front normal standard deviations in the 5-min
records.  This word has fill (99.99) for such records.

Footnote G: 

Derived parameters are obtained from the following equations.

Flow pressure = (2*10**-6)*Np*Vp**2 nPa (Np in cm**-3, 
Vp in km/s, subscript "p" for "proton")

Electric field = -V(km/s) * Bz (nT; GSM) * 10**-3

Plasma beta = [(T*4.16/10**5) + 5.34] * Np / B**2 (B in nT)

Alfven Mach number = (V * Np**0.5) / 20 * B

Footnote K: Magnetosonic Mach Number = V/Magnetosonic_speed
            Magnetosonic speed = [(sound speed)**2 + (Alfv speed)**2]**0.5
            The Alfven speed = 20. * B / N**0.5 
            The sound speed = 0.12 * [T + 1.28*10**5]**0.5
